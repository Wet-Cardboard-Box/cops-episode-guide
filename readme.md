# Context

This is a fork of William "Thrawn" Wolf III's original ["Cops on Fox"
guide](https://copstvfan.github.io/geocities-copsonfox-archive/). Sadly William
[passed away in
2010](https://www.damianofuneralhome.com/obituary/William-WolfIII-1).

This version contains fixes, allows text selection and copying, has better
design and hosting, and will eventually also cover seasons 22 through 34.

Note that this is still a work in progress. You can edit this page via [pull
requests](https://github.com/copsTvFan/cops-episode-guide/pulls). Emails
are also welcome (`copsTvFan` *at* `protonmail.com`).
