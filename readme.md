### S01E01

- **Broward County FL 1** **Hour Pilot** (Full 90 second theme) Burt
  Lancaster - This program was filmed during a one-week period with the
  Broward County Sheriff's Department in Florida.  All Suspects are presumed
  innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.  Sheriff Nick Navarro says
  it’s a unique area - to the east of them they have the Atlantic, to the
  west a big swamp called the Everglades. Because of the fact they have a
  labyrinth of waterways it makes the place very appealing to drug smugglers.
  That’s where they face them on a daily basis. He goes with a SWAT team to a
  crack house, smashing the door and running in. One asks for a sledgehammer,
  they break a door, a man is down.  Watch it you guys, talk to me, back room
  is clear, double check them.  Bathroom is clear. A woman is down in the
  kitchen. Nick says it’s one of the most disgusting sights, the garage is
  another bedroom where they sleep. There is the crack altar where they smoke
  it, paraphernalia where they smoke, down here is the toilet on the floor.
  It’s a bucket. This is a typical crack house, that’s why the close them
  down. He is driving and hears on the radio about another officer taken down
  in the line duty by shooting. He says it always happens to someone else,
  not to you, can tell you one thing, he’s been to too many funerals already.
  He’s had more cops killed in FL in 1987 than the state of NY.  That’s a
  tradition. He goes to the officer's funeral. There is a fire by his house
  on the way home. Nick goes home, asks his wife to get off the phone to call
  in about it. She hangs up. He asks about any flammables there, any
  potential of spread. If you see any potential please let him know and he’ll
  head down. He hangs up, he’s sorry, what a way to come home, that’s the way
  it’s been all day, another beautiful day. On the TV news they say it’s the
  worst fire in the everglades, it’s a chemical plant in the Port. Don from
  the news reports on scene.

  better place. Trojan Horse Briefing.  Cops cut cardboard to make a big box to
  hide inside the back of an an El Camino. Sgt.  Robert Deak says the dogs will
  jump out and get them, can fill the truck up with drug buys. Dealers learn
  what the tactics are - never sell to a van or car with two people in it so
  they have to come up with new ideas. A black guy comes up and sells a rock
  for $10 and wants to sell another $10. They jump out of the box and get him.
  They go to a second stop and grab another black dealer. The driver jokingly
  wants them to let him know if the box falls off. Sgt. says it's exciting
  going after dope.  One day they get the dealers, the next the users.
  Different every day. It is now night time.  The dealer runs and they chase
  him, tackle him and cuff him/He thinks it makes you in touch with the
  community by stopping them from selling crack to kids. Deputy Willie
  Washington says the biggest lie is someone driving through a drug area saying
  they are lost. They stop a driver who says just that. He made a wrong turn
  off the freeway. He says he's heard lots of stories about District 2 - lots
  of violence and shootings.  He didn't want to work there, was scared, but now
  likes it because of the people, they are great. The Lt. stops a car. The
  woman says she was looking for the ocean. They find drugs in the car - a
  cocaine rock.  She says it isn't hers, she just wanted to go home. They ask
  how it got there. She says a guy she stopped for directions must have thrown
  it in there. Then asks if they planted it. They cuff her and put her in the
  back of a car. She wants the cuffs off.  The Lt. says to calm down. She
  won't.  He says she is going to the station and is going to be booked. If she
  didn't do it, tell the judge and if he believes it she'll be free. He reads
  her rights from a card. She can't believe he has a card. At the station they
  book her. He is really nice to her about it. She says again and again she
  can't believe there was a rock in the car and is totally embarrassed.  Deputy
  Linda Canada is doing paperwork in a diner with her fiancé Deputy Jerry
  Wurms. They kiss.
- (11:31 PM 911 Call) She leaves to a call of a mother Nancy and her daughter
  who want her boyfriend not to come back. The daughter cries and says she
  doesn't want him back.  There is also a 22 month old running around. He
  comes back and the daughter screams. She wants to go to a hospital because
  she doesn't want to stay there since she is scared of him and is only 7
  years old. He is arrested and wants the girlfriend to call his mom. Linda
  talks to the 7 year old and says he got drunk and almost hit her.  She
  wants him to stay in jail first for 2 nights, then 4 nights, 10 nights -
  forever since she is scared of him. They give him a trespass warning, he
  can't come back again. She says he is a good man when he isn't on drugs,
  cocaine or whatever. Linda says she needs to make up her mind, but will
  take the children if she doesn't provide a safe environment for them. Linda
  leaves and the girl wants to go with her.  She promises to come back
  tonight and tomorrow. Linda wants to take her out of the house, but most
  likely he'll be back tomorrow since he is the breadwinner and she is scared
  to be alone in the bad neighborhood and the girl will want him out again.
