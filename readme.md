# Cops Episode Guide

View the guide [here](https://copstvfan.github.io/cops-episode-guide/guide).

# Context

This is a fork of William "Thrawn" Wolf III's original ["Cops on Fox"
guide](https://copstvfan.github.io/geocities-copsonfox-archive/). William
passed away in 2010.

This version contains fixes, allows text selection and copying, has better
design and hosting, and will eventually also cover seasons 22 through 34.

Note that this is still a work in progress. You can edit this page via [pull
requests](https://github.com/copsTvFan/cops-episode-guide/pulls). Emails
are also welcome (`copsTvFan` *at* `protonmail.com`).
